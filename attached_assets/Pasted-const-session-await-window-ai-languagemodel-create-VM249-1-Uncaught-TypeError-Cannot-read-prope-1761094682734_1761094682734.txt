VM818:2 It appears you've typed "adasx".  This doesn't have an obvious meaning on its own. Here are a few possibilities, depending on context:

* **Typo:** It could be a simple typo. Perhaps you meant something else?
* **Code/Identifier:**  It might be a code, a product identifier, a file name, or some other specific designation within a particular system.  
* **Acronym/Abbreviation:** It *could* be an acronym, though it's not a common or widely recognized one.  Without context, it's hard to guess what it might stand for.

**To help me understand what you're looking for, please provide more context!  For example:**

* Where did you see "adasx"?
* What were you doing when you typed it?
* What were you trying to find information about?



If you just typed it randomly, that's fine too!  :)
