GetShitDone is a Chrome-native AI productivity extension that automates the entire workflow of knowledge work—from capturing intent to generating detailed daily summaries. It replaces manual task creation and time tracking by interpreting what the user reads, writes, and highlights, then organizing that activity into structured, time-blocked work logs. The extension operates entirely within the browser using Chrome’s built-in AI APIs for summarization, reasoning, and text generation.

The system is built around six modules:

Highlight Capture Engine
When the user highlights text within an email, webpage, or document, GetShitDone uses Chrome’s Summarizer API to interpret the content and extract a clear, actionable task. The Prompt API is then applied to reason about context, determining implied deadlines, priorities, or project categories when they are not explicitly stated. The resulting structured intent is sent to the chosen task manager (for example, Todoist or Google Tasks) and a corresponding focus block is created in Google Calendar. Every task is stored locally with metadata such as source URL, timestamp, and context.

Snapshot Capture Engine
For visual material like PDFs, dashboards, or chat windows, the extension captures a snapshot of the selected region and applies on-device OCR to extract text. The text is summarized and processed through the same Prompt API reasoning layer to infer the appropriate action, deadline, and duration. A task and calendar entry are created automatically, expanding the capture capability beyond plain text.

Task and Calendar Synchronization Layer
This layer keeps the task manager and calendar in sync. It retrieves new or updated entries, logs completion events, and aligns all data with local storage. Each entry is tagged with contextual metadata generated by the Prompt API—project name, estimated effort, and inferred relevance—so the system can later reconstruct what work actually occurred.

Work Context Engine
The Work Context Engine merges the data from tasks and calendar events to build a coherent narrative of the user’s day. It uses the Summarizer API to group related activities into project clusters and the Prompt API to reason about relationships between them—for example, linking “review meeting” calendar entries with “prepare slides” tasks. This produces a clear mapping of how time was spent and what outcomes were achieved. Total hours per project are calculated automatically.

Reporting and Summary Layer
At the end of each day, GetShitDone uses the Writer and Proofreader APIs to generate a refined report written in natural language. The report contains project groupings, task descriptions, total durations, and concise narrative summaries of completed work. It can be displayed within the extension popup, copied directly into a timesheet, or exported as Markdown or CSV. A weekly mode aggregates daily data to show cumulative progress and focus distribution.

Reasoning and Interaction Layer (Prompt API)
The Prompt API serves as the cognitive backbone of the system. It handles all inferential logic, including estimating deadlines from vague phrases, assigning priority levels, determining task type (meeting, deliverable, or reminder), and answering user queries such as “What should I work on next?” or “How much time did I spend on project A?” By embedding reasoning directly in the browser, GetShitDone produces accurate, contextualized outputs without relying on remote services or external models.

Together, these modules transform GetShitDone into a fully autonomous assistant that operates seamlessly in context. Every highlight or screenshot becomes a structured task with a time allocation. Every calendar entry contributes to an automatically generated daily report. The combination of the Summarizer, Prompt, Writer, and Proofreader APIs allows the system not only to record work but to understand and narrate it. Built to run locally for privacy and speed, GetShitDone gives professionals a frictionless, verifiable record of their productivity—ready for status reports, timesheets, or end-of-day reflection.
