# Hackathon Winner Enhancement Plan

## Overview

Transform GetShitDone to target **Most Helpful ($14k)** and **Best Multimodal ($9k)** prizes by adding cutting-edge multimodal capabilities, additional Chrome AI APIs, hybrid AI architecture, and real-world integrations.

## Core Enhancements

### 1. Multimodal AI Implementation (High Priority)

**Goal:** Showcase Prompt API's multimodal capabilities with image and audio input

#### Screenshot + OCR Task Capture

- Add context menu "Capture Screenshot as Task" on right-click
- Implement region selection UI overlay for capturing specific screen areas
- Use Chrome's built-in screenshot API (`chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab`)
- Pass captured image to **Prompt API with image input** for visual task extraction
- Extract tasks from: PDFs, dashboards, Slack/Teams messages, design mockups, meeting slides
- Display thumbnails in task list with visual context

#### Audio Task Capture

- Add "Record Voice Task" button in popup and context menu
- Use MediaRecorder API to capture audio notes
- Pass audio to **Prompt API with audio input** for transcription + task extraction
- Support meeting notes, quick voice memos, phone call summaries
- Auto-detect action items, deadlines, and attendees from audio

**Files to modify:** `manifest.json` (add permissions), `content.js`, `background.js`, `popup.js`

### 2. Additional Chrome AI APIs Integration

**Goal:** Demonstrate comprehensive use of all available Chrome AI APIs

#### Translator API

- Add "Translate Task" feature for multilingual task descriptions
- Auto-detect user's preferred language from browser settings
- Translate task summaries for international collaboration
- Add language selector in settings

#### Rewriter API

- "Improve Task Description" button to refine vague highlights
- Auto-rewrite tasks for clarity and professionalism
- Multiple tone options: concise, detailed, professional

#### Proofreader API

- Auto-correct grammar in captured tasks before saving
- Polish daily summaries for professional presentation
- Real-time proofreading in Quick Capture textarea

**Files to modify:** `background.js`, `popup.js`, `popup.html`

### 3. Hybrid AI Architecture (Firebase + Gemini)

**Goal:** Qualify for Best Hybrid AI prize and enable advanced features

#### Firebase AI Logic Integration

- Set up Firebase project with AI Logic endpoints
- Implement advanced reasoning for:
- Task dependency detection (what blocks what)
- Smart deadline prediction based on historical patterns
- Workload balancing recommendations
- Project impact analysis
- Use local Chrome AI for speed, Firebase for complex reasoning
- Implement fallback chain: Chrome AI → Firebase → Manual

#### Cross-Task Intelligence

- Analyze task relationships across days/weeks
- Detect recurring patterns and suggest automation
- Generate weekly strategic insights (not just summaries)

**New files:** `firebase-config.js`, `hybrid-ai.js`

### 4. Real Task Manager Integrations

**Goal:** Demonstrate scalability and real-world utility

#### Todoist Integration

- OAuth authentication flow
- Bi-directional sync: create tasks, mark complete, sync status
- Project mapping: auto-assign to Todoist projects

#### Notion Integration

- Create tasks in Notion databases
- Support custom properties and templates
- Sync status and completion

#### Linear Integration (for dev teams)

- Create issues from captured tasks
- Auto-assign team members based on project
- Link to related issues

#### Google Calendar (Complete Implementation)

- Replace stub with full OAuth + Calendar API
- Time-block tasks automatically
- Sync completion status

**New files:** `integrations/todoist.js`, `integrations/notion.js`, `integrations/linear.js`, `google-auth.js` (enhance existing)

### 5. Enhanced UX & Visualization

**Goal:** Impress judges with polish and usability

#### Visual Dashboard

- Time distribution chart (project breakdown visualization)
- Week-view calendar with task overlay
- Productivity heatmap showing focus patterns
- Task completion trends

#### Smart Suggestions

- "What should I work on next?" AI-powered recommendations
- Proactive deadline warnings
- Workload balancing alerts

#### Export Options

- Enhanced Markdown export with metadata
- CSV export for timesheets
- JSON export for data portability
- Direct export to task managers

**Files to modify:** `popup.html`, `popup.css`, new `charts.js`

### 6. Privacy & Performance Features

**Goal:** Emphasize local-first, privacy-preserving architecture

#### Local-First Architecture

- Highlight that image/audio processing happens on-device
- No data sent to servers except explicit integrations (with permission)
- Add privacy dashboard showing data flow

#### Performance Optimizations

- Implement caching for AI sessions
- Background processing for summaries
- Efficient storage with IndexedDB migration

**Files to modify:** `background.js`, new `storage-manager.js`

## Implementation Priority

**TODAY - Multimodal Features (Screenshot OCR + Audio)**

1. Screenshot capture with region selection UI
2. Prompt API image input integration for OCR task extraction
3. Audio recording UI and MediaRecorder implementation
4. Prompt API audio input for voice-to-task conversion
5. UI enhancements to display image thumbnails and audio indicators
6. Test multimodal features end-to-end

**Future Sessions:**

- Additional Chrome AI APIs (Translator, Rewriter, Proofreader)
- Firebase hybrid AI architecture
- Task manager integrations (Todoist, Calendar, Notion, Linear)
- Enhanced visualizations and dashboard
- Demo video and final polish

## Key Differentiators for Judges

1. **Most Comprehensive API Usage:** Using 6+ Chrome AI APIs in meaningful ways
2. **True Multimodal:** Image AND audio input with practical use cases
3. **Smart Hybrid Strategy:** Local for speed/privacy, cloud for intelligence
4. **Production-Ready:** Real integrations that people will actually use
5. **Privacy-First:** Showcases local AI benefits while maintaining functionality

## Demo Video Script

1. Show user reading email → highlight task → AI extracts with deadline
2. Screenshot a dashboard → AI creates tasks from visual content
3. Voice memo "Need to finish Q4 report by Friday" → task created
4. Generate daily summary in multiple languages (Translator)
5. Show hybrid AI suggesting task priorities based on patterns
6. Sync to Todoist/Calendar in real-time
7. Display beautiful analytics dashboard

This positions GetShitDone as the most complete, practical, and impressive demonstration of Chrome's built-in AI capabilities.
